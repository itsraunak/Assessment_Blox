Elaborate what your internship or academic projects were?
During my internship at Deltanow Technologies, I worked as a Software Developer intern from January 2021 to April 2021. 
My primary project was to create a REST API for Payment Management and Attendance Tracking, 
which was integrated into the Gitam University website. The purpose of this system was to empower 
over 1000 students across four campuses by providing them with essential functionalities related to fee payments, 
attendance tracking, and placement services. The main goal was to enhance the overall user experience and streamline 
these critical processes for the university and its students.

Q) What did the system do?

The system I developed consisted of a set of REST APIs that allowed students to securely make fee payments online,
check and track their attendance records, and access placement services offered by the university.
The APIs acted as an intermediary between the user interface (the Gitam University website) and the backend 
databases or services responsible for handling these functionalities. 
By using these APIs, students could conveniently perform these tasks without any manual intervention.

Q) What other systems have you seen in the wild like that?

In the industry, there are numerous systems similar to the one I developed for Gitam University. 
Many educational institutions and organizations implement web-based platforms that facilitate online fee payments, 
attendance tracking, and placement services for their students. These systems are designed to streamline 
administrative processes and enhance the overall student experience.

Q) How do you approach the development problem?

When approaching the development problem, I followed a systematic process. First, I thoroughly understood the requirements
and specifications provided by the Gitam University team. Next, I designed the architecture of the REST API system, 
ensuring it aligns with the existing infrastructure of the university's website. I then broke down the project into 
smaller tasks and prioritized them based on their importance and dependencies. Throughout the development process, 
I regularly communicated with the team to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments. Additionally, 
I followed industry best practices and standards to ensure the code was maintainable, efficient, and secure.


Q) What were interesting aspects where you copied code from Stack Overflow?

During the development process, there were instances where I referred to code snippets on Stack Overflow to solve specific challenges 
or to implement certain features more effectively. It's important to note that while using Stack Overflow or other online resources is common and helpful, 
proper attribution and understanding of the code are crucial to avoid any ethical or legal issues.


Q) What did you learn from some very specific copy-paste? Mention explicitly some of them?

One specific instance where I copied code from Stack Overflow was when implementing a complex algorithm to calculate and update attendance records 
based on various parameters. The code snippet I found on Stack Overflow provided an optimized solution for handling large datasets efficiently. 
By carefully studying the code, I learned about the importance of algorithmic efficiency and how using the right data structures and techniques 
can significantly impact the performance of the system.

Another example was when I needed to implement secure payment processing. I found a code snippet on Stack Overflow that demonstrated the proper 
usage of encryption and data validation to ensure sensitive payment information was handled securely. This experience taught me the significance 
of data security and the potential risks associated with payment-related functionalities in an application.

In both cases, I not only gained a deeper understanding of the specific coding techniques but also learned about the importance of leveraging community 
resources like Stack Overflow to enhance the development process. However, it's crucial always to comprehend the code being used and adapt it to fit the 
specific context and requirements of the project.
